===========

**In Development**

Changelog

- |Enhancement| Add :func:`sktree.experimental.conditional_resample`, which allows conditional resampling of rows based on nearest-neighbors defined via a feature set, by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`152`)
- |API| ``FeatureImportanceForest*`` now has a hyperparameter to control the number of permutations is done per forest ``permute_per_forest_fraction``, by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`145`)
- |Enhancement| Add dataset generators for regression and classification and hypothesis testing, by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`169`)
