Version 0.8
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------

- |Fix| Previously missing-values in ``X`` input array for sktree estimators
    did not raise an error, and silently ran, assuming the missing-values were
    encoded as infinity value. This is now fixed, and the estimators will raise an
    ValueError if missing-values are encountered in ``X`` input array.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#264`)
