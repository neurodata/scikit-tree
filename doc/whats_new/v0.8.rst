Version 0.8
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------
- |Fix| Trunk simulators now correctly generate random values with a fixed seed,
    by `Sambit Panda`_ (:pr:`#236`)
- |Efficiency| All scikit-tree estimators are now at least 2X faster than they were
    in previous versions. This was due to adding in compiler-directives to turn on 
    optimizations '-03' when compiling the C++ generated code from Cython. In addition,
    we explicitly turned off bounds-checking and related runtime checks in the Cython code,
    which would lead to performance degradation during runtime. by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#242`)
