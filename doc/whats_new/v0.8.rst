Version 0.8
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------

- |Fix| Previously missing-values in ``X`` input array for sktree estimators
    did not raise an error, and silently ran, assuming the missing-values were
    encoded as infinity value. This is now fixed, and the estimators will raise an
    ValueError if missing-values are encountered in ``X`` input array.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#264`)
- |Feature| Simulations in ``sktree.datasets.hyppo`` now throw a warning instead
    of an error when the number of samples is less than the number of dimensions.
    By `Sambit Panda`_ (:pr:`#279`)
- |API| :class:`sktree.HonestForestClassifier` now has ``bootstrap=True`` as the default
    argument. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |API| Removed all instances of ``FeatureImportanceForestClassifier`` and outdated
    MIGHT code. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |Fix| Fixed a bug in the ``sktree.HonestForestClassifier`` where posteriors
    estimated on oob samples were biased when there was a low number of samples
    due to imbalance in the classes when ``bootstrap=True``.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#283`)
